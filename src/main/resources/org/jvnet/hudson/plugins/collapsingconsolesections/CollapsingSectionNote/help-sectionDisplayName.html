<div>
    Provide a string that will be displayed in the section header, and in the left-side section navigator.
    <br/>
    When viewing a build console, a heading will be placed above a line that matches this regex. 
    The visibility of all console output between this line and the next line that 
    matches the ending pattern can be toggled by clicking the Show/Hide action in the heading. 
    <ul>
        <li>Sections can be nested</li>
        <li>You can use {N} regex syntax in order to extract the section name from the first line. Example:
            <ul>
                <li>Section name: <i>Section {2}</i></li>
                <li>Section starts from: <i>^\#(BEGIN SECTION)\s+(\w+)\#$</i></li>
                <li>In this example name will be extracted from the third word in the first section line</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
